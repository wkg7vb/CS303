Professional Employees can be built using only a monthly salary, the weekly pay is calculated based on a 30 day month. They have a set 15 vacation days per year and 5% contribution to health care.

Nonprofessional Employees require an amount of hours per week, an hourly wage and a choice on contribution to be created. They choose a set amount of hours to work per week, and hours * wage is their weekly pay. The amount of hours they work rounded down to the nearest 10 (X) determines the amount of vacation days they get, 2X + 2. They can choose between 0% and 5% contributions to health care.

Using one employee of each type, the professional has a monthly salary of $10,000, and the nonprofessional employee works 45 hours per week at $25 dollars per hour, choosing a 4% contribution rate, these are the resultant weekly pay, vacation days, and health care contributions.
